Your task is to write a program which:

-asks the user for the input file's name;
-reads the file (if possible) and counts all the Latin letters (lower- and upper-case letters are treated as equal)
-prints a simple histogram in alphabetical order (only non-zero counts should be presented)
Create a test file for the code, and check if your histogram contains valid results.

Assuming that the test file contains just one line filled with:

aBc

the expected output should look as follows:
a -> 1
b -> 1
c -> 1

Tip:

We think that a dictionary is a perfect data collection medium for storing the counts. The letters may be keys while the counters can be values.
